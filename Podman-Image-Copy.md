There are a few effective ways to move a Podman image to another host, depending on your specific needs and environment.

### 1\. `podman image scp` (Recommended for direct host-to-host transfers)

This is the most direct and modern method, specifically designed for this purpose. It uses SSH to securely copy an image from one host to another without the need for an intermediary registry.

**Syntax:**

To copy from your local machine to a remote host:

```bash
podman image scp IMAGE_NAME[:TAG] USERNAME@HOSTNAME::
```

To copy from a remote host to your local machine:

```bash
podman image scp USERNAME@HOSTNAME::IMAGE_NAME[:TAG] .
```

To copy between two remote hosts:

```bash
podman image scp USERNAME1@HOSTNAME1::IMAGE_NAME[:TAG] USERNAME2@HOSTNAME2::
```

**Example:**

```bash
podman image scp my-app:latest myuser@remote-server.com::
```

This command will handle the saving and loading process for you, making it very convenient.

### 2\. `podman save` and `podman load`

This is a classic and robust method that works well in many scenarios, especially if you need to transfer the image manually (e.g., via a USB drive or a different file transfer protocol).

**Step 1: Save the image on the source host.**

The `podman save` command packages the image into a single tarball file.

```bash
podman image save -o my-image.tar IMAGE_NAME[:TAG]
```

**Step 2: Transfer the tarball.**

Use a tool like `scp`, `rsync`, or even a physical medium to move the `my-image.tar` file to the destination host.

```bash
scp my-image.tar myuser@remote-host.com:/path/to/destination/
```

**Step 3: Load the image on the destination host.**

Once the file is on the new host, use `podman load` to import the image into Podman's local storage.

```bash
podman image load -i /path/to/destination/my-image.tar
```

You can combine these steps into a single, chained command for a one-liner transfer:

```bash
podman image save IMAGE_NAME[:TAG] | ssh myuser@remote-host.com 'podman image load'
```

### 3\. Using a Container Registry

This is the standard, production-ready way to share images between hosts, especially in a team or enterprise environment. It involves pushing the image to a central repository and then pulling it from the destination host.

**Step 1: Tag the image with the registry address.**

Before you can push an image, you need to tag it with the full registry path.

```bash
podman tag IMAGE_NAME[:TAG] REGISTRY_URL/NAMESPACE/IMAGE_NAME[:TAG]
```

**Example:**

```bash
podman tag my-app:latest registry.gitlab.com/my-project/my-app:latest
```

**Step 2: Log in to the registry (if it's private).**

```bash
podman login REGISTRY_URL
```

**Step 3: Push the image to the registry.**

```bash
podman push REGISTRY_URL/NAMESPACE/IMAGE_NAME[:TAG]
```

**Step 4: On the destination host, pull the image.**

```bash
podman pull REGISTRY_URL/NAMESPACE/IMAGE_NAME[:TAG]
```

This method is the most scalable and provides version control, security, and a single source of truth for your images. It's the best practice for a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow.
